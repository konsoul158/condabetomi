# Contest of The Best Tosta Mista

A simple reactjs frontend that allows for a memorable friend's contest! 
See who is the best chef at assembling the best grilled Ham N' cheese (Tosta Mista in portuguese).

Each chef will have to participate creating it's entry in the contest pool, which consists of: A name for their Tosta; Own name, as the owner of the Tosta; The contents of the Tosta.
Then procede to assemble the Tostas.

After everyone tastes such incredible Tostas, it's time to evaluate using the world's most reliable way of evaluating, from 0 to 10!

In the end the results are displayed (not in order, I am sorry).
